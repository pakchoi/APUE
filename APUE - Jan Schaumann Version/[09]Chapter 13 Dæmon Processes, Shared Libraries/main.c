/* This simple program can be used to illustrate how shared libraries
 * work.  We use function prototypes to forward-declare the 'ldtest'
 * functions, which are implemented in the ldtest[12].c files.
 *
 * Compiling this file along works, but linking it will fail.
 *
 * Compiling main.c and ldtest[12].c in one step will work.
 *
 * Compiling main.c and ldtest[12].c into object files, then linking them
 * together into an executable will work.
 *
 * You can then also create an archive of the ldtest[12].o files and
 * create a dynamically linked executable from that; likewise, you can
 * then create a statically linked binary using the archive.
 *
 * Finally, you can build a shared library from the ldtest[12].o files and
 * link this program against it.
